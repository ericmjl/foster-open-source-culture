::: {callout-note}
I move through projects as my needs and interests evolve.
:::

## Open source  was formative for my thinking

- Year: 2015
- Project: Matplotlib.
- Task: MEP12 examples gallery

![](./images/first-mpl-pr.webp)

## Me, the newbie, was given simple tasks...

::: panel-tabset
## Old

```python
from pylab import *

x = arange(0, 3, 1000)
y = 0.32 * x + 35

plot(x, y)
```

## New

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(0, 3, 1000)
y = 0.32 * x + 35

plt.plot(x, y)
```
:::

The training steps, and repetition, helped me grow my skillset.

## ...88 PRs later...

![My first contributions to the open source world were with matplotlib.](./images/matplotlib.webp)


## ...then I realized software skills mattered...

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbtcsGE0OA width="560" height="315" >}}

We need to write code. Organizing that code (building software) will massively save our sanity. (see [blog](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2024/4/17/how-llms-can-accelerate-data-science/))

## ...and imported ways of working to my work and home team...

::: panel-tabset
## Opened

Every data scientist can see every codebase by all other data science teams (unless there is sensitive information).

## Refactored

Investments here clarify one's thinking about our domain problem.

We cut future frustrations untangling messy code and fragile configuration.

## Tested

Investment of time here ensures the correctness of our work.

We spend much less time in the future being burned by changes that introduced subtle bugs.

## Documented

Investments here yield multiplicative effects on impact.

Mirroring sprints, [we run quarterly docathons](https://ericmjl.github.io/blog/2024/6/30/two-years-of-docathons-insights-and-lessons-learned/) that provide focused time for us to write high impact docs with high ROI.

## ...creating cultural compatibility with OSS!

I wanted to instill a compatible culture of empowerment and self-directed agency within the Moderna DSAI teams:

::: incremental
-   Collaboration: stewarded and shared ownership of code.
-   Contribution: co-creation of new features.
-   Community: increased investment in ecosystem.
:::

## CBOSS vs. CDOSS

[Articulated by Travis Oliphant](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-governs-open-source-project-you-depend-travis-oliphant/), these are two different flavours of open source software.

::: incremental
-   CBOSS: **C**ompany-**B**acked **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware
-   CDOSS: **C**ommunity-**D**riven **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware
:::

## Diverse motivations

::: panel-tabset
## Services

-   [Quansight](https://quansight.com/)
-   [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.com/)
-   [Enthought](https://www.enthought.com/)
-   ...

Consulting around open source sustains and grows demand for open source software, which sustains consulting business.

## Products

-   [Posit PBC](https://posit.co/): Shiny/R/tidyverse
-   [Union.ai](https://www.union.ai/features): Flyte
-   NVIDIA: RAPIDS
-   ...

Community engagement gives a customer path to profitable services.

## Talent Acquisition

-   TD Ameritrade: [STUMPY](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy)
-   Novartis: [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit)
-   Moderna: [SeqLike](https://github.com/modernatx/seqlike)
-   ...

OSS releases are primarily a marketing tool to attract new talent. OSS release has no direct impact on core products & services.

[CBOSS must fit strategically within organizational motivations]{style="font-size:120px"}

## Interested parties have motivations

| Party        | Interest                                                |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| [Data Science]{style="color:red"} | [Building a professional portfolio.]{style="color:red"}                      |
| [Legal]{style="color:orange"}        | [Protecting company IP.]{style="color:orange"} |
| [Management]{style="color:green"}   | [Minimizing operational disruption.]{style="color:green"}                      |
| [Executive]{style="color:blue"}    | [Enhancing reputation & value creation.]{style="color:blue"}             |

You may need \>1 of these parties to have buy-in before you can release open source software.

## Ways to articulate

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Data Science

**Goal:** Build professional portfolio.

- Long-term investment in company's reputation as a technologically competent company.
- Professional development opportunity for individual contributors.

## Legal

**Goal:** Protect company IP.

- Show evidence that open source release is not novel IP, using existing literature.
- Articulate criteria used to evaluate whether contributions from within the company are open source-able or not.

## Management

**Goal:** Minimize operational disruption.

- Articulate set schedule for activities related to stewardship of OSS software, such as reviewing PRs.
- Articulate prospective leverage in internal work from external contributions.

## Executive

**Goal:** Enhance reputation and value creation

- Identify peer group companies that are engaged in similar activities.
- Articulate prospective leverage in internal work from external contributions.

## How do we foster an open source culture within our companies?

::: incremental
1. Import open source ways of working into the team.
2. Articulate value to multiple stakeholders in a way that is aligned with their interests.
